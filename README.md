    Description
  </h2>
  <p>
    A program that will allow users to deploy applications on servers. This project is called minecraft admin as a test run and a learning opportunity to deploy a multiplayer application server on a in-site computer.

    Planning
  </h2>
  <p>
  In this project we will create a web page API to interact with the Minecraft server (mac mini). Web Application will be created in Flask and will use the macOS computer as a host. A container image via Docker will be used to deploy the webpage, database and Minecraft server. Overtime we will maintain this API for future use and develop more features.
