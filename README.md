In this project we will create a web page API to interact with the Minecraft server (mac mini). Web API will be created in Flask. We will use macOS as a host and will use a container (Docker) to deploy webpage and Minecraft server. Overtime we will maintain this API for future use and develop more features.



DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) (Providing multiple IP addresses)

DNS (Domain name system, translating domain names to IP addresses)



API

* List available servers
* List players in server
* Server Options



Minecraft Server Options

* Map Selection 
* Difficulty
* Game Mode
* XP
* Summon 
* Reload
* Stop



Phase I (Flask API Creation)



Phase II (API Interaction)



Phase III (Server and API Interaction)

Note:
* We need to have a python installer folder for spectific architecture (ARM64,Win,OSX) for container usage.
