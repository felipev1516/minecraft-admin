    Description
  </h2>
  <p>
    This project will be a Service Deployment Portal to allow clients to deploy any microservices of their liking. As of now, the repository is called minecraft admin since it will be forerunner to deploy a Minecraft multiplayer application server on a in-site computer for testing and learning purposes.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Planning
  </h2>
  <p>
  In this project we will create a web page API to interact with the Minecraft server (mac mini). Web framework we'll use in this project is Flask and have a backend API to commnunicate to a macOS device to deploy the service. A container on Docker will be used to deploy the webpage and database on the host. We will also utilize kubernetes to manage other containers found on other in-site devices for management and deployment. Overtime we will maintain the portal and API for future use and develop more features.
